# Authentication

Tactna allows authentication processing to be delegated to your chosen Identity Provider (IdP).
Supported IdPs: **Auth0**, **Amazon Cognito**.

The available features vary depending on the IdP.
When using **Auth0**, you can leverage the **Universal Login page**, meaning most of authentication features provided by Auth0 are available out of the box.
When using **Cognito**, Tactna provides its own **Managed Login page**. Cognito hosted UI are not available due to architectural constraints required to support Tactna's advanced data model. These constraints are not limitations, but design trade-offs to *enhance* Cognito's value within Tactna.

Some features may not well supported. Please contact technical support for those issues.

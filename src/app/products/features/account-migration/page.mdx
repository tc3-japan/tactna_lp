# Account Migration

Tactna provides comprehensive tools and workflows to migrate user accounts, teams, and identity data from existing systems to Tactna—or between different Identity Providers within Tactna.
Whether you're consolidating multiple identity systems, switching IdPs, or onboarding from legacy platforms, Tactna ensures a secure, seamless migration experience.

---

## Migration from External Systems

Migrate user accounts and organizational data from legacy systems, existing identity providers, or custom-built authentication solutions.

* **User Data Import**: Import user profiles, credentials, and attributes from CSV, JSON, or API sources.
* **Bulk User Migration**: Migrate thousands of users efficiently with batch processing.
* **Password Migration**: Support for password hash migration from common systems (bcrypt, scrypt, PBKDF2).
* **Progressive Migration**: Migrate users gradually using just-in-time migration during login.
* **Data Mapping**: Map custom attributes from source systems to Tactna's data model.
* **Validation & Testing**: Validate migration data before committing to production.


## Team & Organization Migration

Migrate complete organizational structures, including teams, hierarchies, and memberships.

* **Organizational Hierarchy Import**: Preserve parent-child relationships and team structures.
* **Team Membership Migration**: Import team memberships with roles and permissions.
* **Bulk Team Creation**: Create multiple teams with predefined configurations and policies.
* **Relationship Preservation**: Maintain inter-team relationships and access policies.
* **Custom Team Attributes**: Migrate team-specific metadata and custom fields.


## IdP-to-IdP Migration

Seamlessly migrate between different Identity Providers (e.g., from Auth0 to Cognito, or vice versa) while maintaining user experience and data integrity.

* **Cross-IdP User Migration**: Move users between Auth0 and Amazon Cognito with minimal disruption.
* **Session Continuity**: Maintain active sessions during migration where possible.
* **Credential Transfer**: Preserve authentication methods and credentials during IdP switches.
* **Gradual Rollout**: Migrate users in phases to minimize risk and ensure stability.
* **Rollback Capability**: Safely revert to the previous IdP if issues arise.


## Zero-Downtime Migration

Execute migrations with minimal or zero downtime to avoid disrupting user access.

* **Phased Migration**: Roll out migration in controlled phases (e.g., by team, by percentage).
* **Dual-Mode Operation**: Run both old and new systems in parallel during transition.
* **Automatic Synchronization**: Keep user data synchronized between systems during migration period.
* **Traffic Routing**: Gradually route authentication traffic to the new system.
* **Health Monitoring**: Monitor migration progress and system health in real-time.


## User Communication & Experience

Ensure users are informed and experience minimal friction during migration.

* **Automated User Notifications**: Send emails to users informing them of migration timelines.
* **Password Reset Flows**: Trigger secure password reset flows for users who need to update credentials.
* **Self-Service Re-Authentication**: Allow users to link their existing accounts to the new system.
* **Migration Status Tracking**: Provide users with visibility into their migration status.
* **Support Documentation**: Auto-generate user guides specific to your migration scenario.


## Data Validation & Integrity

Ensure data accuracy and integrity throughout the migration process.

* **Pre-Migration Validation**: Verify data format, completeness, and consistency before migration.
* **Duplicate Detection**: Identify and resolve duplicate user accounts across systems.
* **Data Transformation**: Transform data formats to match Tactna's schema requirements.
* **Post-Migration Verification**: Validate that all data migrated successfully and accurately.
* **Audit Logs**: Maintain detailed logs of all migration activities for compliance and troubleshooting.


## Migration Tools & API

Access powerful tools and APIs to automate and customize your migration process.

* **Migration API**: Programmatically migrate users, teams, and data via REST API.
* **CLI Migration Tools**: Command-line utilities for scripted, automated migrations.
* **Migration Dashboards**: Web-based interface to monitor and control migration progress.
* **Custom Scripts**: Write custom migration scripts using Tactna's SDK and libraries.
* **Dry Run Mode**: Test migration workflows without affecting production data.


## Rollback & Recovery

Protect your migration with robust rollback and recovery capabilities.

* **Point-in-Time Snapshots**: Take snapshots before migration for quick rollback.
* **Incremental Rollback**: Roll back specific batches or phases without affecting others.
* **Data Recovery**: Recover data from backups if issues occur during migration.
* **Failure Handling**: Automatic retry and error handling for failed migration operations.
* **Emergency Stop**: Ability to pause or stop migration immediately if critical issues arise.


## Common Migration Scenarios

* **Legacy System to Tactna**: Migrate from homegrown authentication systems or outdated identity platforms.
* **Auth0 to Cognito**: Switch from Auth0 to Amazon Cognito while preserving user experience.
* **Cognito to Auth0**: Migrate from Amazon Cognito to Auth0 for enhanced features.
* **Multi-Tenant Consolidation**: Merge multiple isolated tenant systems into unified Tactna platform.
* **M&A Integration**: Integrate acquired companies' identity systems into your platform.

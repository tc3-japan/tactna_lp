# Authorization

Tactna provides comprehensive authorization capabilities to control access to your resources with fine-grained precision.

---

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

* Roles can be defined per **Team type**, allowing fine-grained access control.


## Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

* You can define custom attributes and include them in ID/access tokens, allowing applications to enforce fine-grained authorization.


## Resource-level Permissions

* Define role with granular permissions at the **page**, **feature**, or **data** level.
* Policies can also express inter-team relationships, such as "Team A can view Teams B and C."


## Delegated Access / Impersonation

* Enables **impersonation**, e.g., an admin of Team A can log in as a manager of Team B and act on their behalf.

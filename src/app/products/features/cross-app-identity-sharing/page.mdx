# Cross-App Identity Sharing

Tactna provides a unified identity layer that enables seamless authentication and access across multiple applications within your enterprise digital ecosystem.
By centralizing identity at the platform level, users can sign in once and securely access all authorized applications—reducing friction while maintaining strict boundaries and governance for each app.

---

## Unified Identity Layer

Tactna serves as a unified identity hub, enabling multiple applications to rely on a single, authoritative source for authentication and authorization.
This approach eliminates redundant user provisioning, streamlines access management, and ensures consistency of identity data across your ecosystem.

* **Single Source of Truth**: Maintain one authoritative user directory across all applications.
* **Centralized User Provisioning**: Provision users once and grant access to multiple applications.
* **Consistent Identity Data**: Ensure user profiles, attributes, and roles are synchronized across apps.
* **Reduced Data Duplication**: Eliminate the need for separate user databases per application.
* **Simplified User Management**: Manage users from a single control plane across your entire ecosystem.


## Seamless SSO Experience

Provide users with a frictionless Single Sign-On experience across applications under the same tenant or organization.
Sessions and tokens are securely shared under Tactna's access governance framework.

* **Cross-Application SSO**: Users sign in once and access all authorized applications without re-authentication.
* **Unified Session Management**: Maintain consistent session state across multiple applications.
* **Token Sharing**: Securely share access tokens between applications under governance policies.
* **Silent Authentication**: Applications can silently obtain tokens without user interaction.
* **Single Logout (SLO)**: Users can log out from all applications with a single action.


## Centralized Governance

Define and enforce access policies globally, while maintaining app-level autonomy.
Administrators can audit user access across all integrated apps through a single control plane.

* **Global Access Policies**: Define organization-wide policies that apply across all applications.
* **App-Level Customization**: Allow individual applications to define additional policies and permissions.
* **Unified Audit Trail**: Track user access and activities across all applications from one dashboard.
* **Compliance Reporting**: Generate cross-application compliance reports for regulatory requirements.
* **Access Reviews**: Conduct periodic access reviews across all applications simultaneously.


## Application Isolation & Boundaries

While identity is shared, Tactna ensures proper isolation between applications to maintain security and data privacy.

* **Application-Specific Permissions**: Define which users can access which applications.
* **Resource Isolation**: Ensure application data remains isolated unless explicitly shared.
* **Custom Scopes**: Define application-specific OAuth scopes for fine-grained access control.
* **Data Residency Controls**: Enforce data residency requirements per application or tenant.
* **Independent Deployment**: Applications can be deployed and updated independently while sharing identity.


## Team-Level Identity Sharing

Share identity context at the team level, allowing users to access applications based on their team memberships.

* **Team-Based Application Access**: Grant entire teams access to applications with a single configuration.
* **Automatic Provisioning**: New team members automatically gain access to team-authorized applications.
* **Team Context in Tokens**: Include team information in tokens for application-level authorization.
* **Cross-Team Boundaries**: Control how users access applications across different teams.
* **Hierarchical Access**: Support parent-child team relationships in application access control.


## User Experience Benefits

* **Reduced Login Friction**: Users authenticate once and access all applications seamlessly.
* **Consistent User Profile**: User profile data is consistent across all applications.
* **Simplified Password Management**: Users maintain a single set of credentials for all applications.
* **Unified User Preferences**: Share user preferences and settings across applications where appropriate.


## Developer & Admin Benefits

* **Simplified Integration**: Applications integrate with a single identity provider instead of managing their own.
* **Reduced Maintenance**: No need to maintain separate user databases and authentication systems.
* **Faster Onboarding**: New applications can be integrated quickly with minimal setup.
* **Centralized Monitoring**: Monitor authentication and access across all applications from one place.
* **Consistent Security Posture**: Apply consistent security policies across all applications.

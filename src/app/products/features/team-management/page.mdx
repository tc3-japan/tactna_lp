# Team Management

A "team" in Tactna represents any collaborative unit—whether it's a **company**, **department**, **family**, or **community**.
Tactna provides a unified framework for managing complex organizational structures, giving you precise control over memberships, roles, and governance.

## Team Directory & Profile Management

Maintain a centralized view of all teams within your organization.
Track profiles, attributes, and relationships to keep visibility across departments and partner networks.

* **Centralized Team Directory**: A single source of truth for all teams across your platform.
* **Team Profiles**: Store team-specific information, metadata, and custom attributes.
* **Team Attributes**: Define custom fields to support your organizational requirements.
* **Multi-Level Visibility**: Track relationships between parent and child teams.
* **Cross-Tenant Teams**: Support teams that span multiple tenants or applications.


## Membership & Invitation Management

Invite members and assign roles within each team.
Designed for secure onboarding and clear role distribution across internal or external collaborators.

* **Member Invitations**: Send secure invitations with pre-configured roles and permissions.
* **Role Assignment**: Assign and modify member roles based on team-specific access requirements.
* **External Collaborators**: Safely onboard partners and external users with limited permissions.
* **Invitation Expiry**: Set time-limited invitations for enhanced security.
* **Bulk Invitations**: Invite multiple users at once with CSV import or API integration.
* **Pending Requests**: Review and approve membership requests from users.


## Team Self-Management

Empower selected team administrators to manage members, settings, and invitations independently—while keeping compliance with global governance rules.

* **Delegated Administration**: Allow team admins to manage their own teams without platform-level access.
* **Self-Service Member Management**: Team admins can invite, remove, and manage member roles.
* **Team Settings Control**: Configure team-level preferences, branding, and policies.
* **Governance Guardrails**: Enforce platform-wide policies even with delegated administration.
* **Audit Visibility**: Platform admins retain full audit trail of all team-level actions.


## Team Policies & Hierarchical Governance

Tactna supports hierarchical team types, enabling multiple layers of governance within your enterprise.
Define policies and interface terminology per team, allowing local autonomy without losing central oversight.

* **Team Types**: Define multiple team types (e.g., organization, department, project) with distinct policies.
* **Hierarchical Structures**: Support parent-child relationships for complex organizational models.
* **Policy Inheritance**: Child teams inherit policies from parent teams, with option to override.
* **Custom Terminology**: Tailor UI labels and terminology per team type (e.g., "workspace," "company," "group").
* **Access Control Policies**: Define who can create, view, or manage teams at each level.
* **Inter-Team Relationships**: Express relationships like "Team A can access Team B's resources."


## Team Lifecycle Control

Gain complete visibility and control over each team's lifecycle.
Define custom lifecycle states—such as onboarding, active, or maintenance—to align operations with organizational governance and internal workflows.

* **Team Creation**: Provision new teams with templates and default settings.
* **Activation**: Enable teams to start onboarding members and accessing resources.
* **Suspension**: Temporarily disable team access without deleting data.
* **Archival**: Move inactive teams to archived state for compliance and auditing.
* **Deletion**: Permanently remove teams with configurable data retention policies.
* **Custom States**: Define organization-specific team states (e.g., trial, onboarding, maintenance).
* **Automated Workflows**: Trigger actions based on team lifecycle transitions.
* **Lifecycle Reporting**: Track team lifecycle metrics and generate compliance reports.

## User Directory & Profile Management

Easily manage user profiles, custom attributes, and metadata across tenants.
Tactna's directory model supports both global and tenant-local contexts, enabling flexible multi-tenant data isolation.

* **Centralized User Directory**: Maintain a single source of truth for all user identities across your platform.
* **Custom Attributes**: Define and manage custom user attributes to support your business requirements.
* **Metadata Management**: Store and retrieve user metadata for enhanced context and personalization.
* **Multi-Tenant Support**: Isolate user data per tenant while maintaining central governance.


## Identity Management & Federation

Connect external Identity Providers (SAML, OIDC) to unify authentication flows.
Users can seamlessly link or switch identities while preserving access control consistency.

* **Identity Linking**: Connect multiple identities to a single user account.
* **External IdP Integration**: Support for SAML and OIDC-based identity providers.
* **Federation Management**: Enable users to authenticate through their organization's IdP.
* **Seamless Identity Switching**: Users can switch between linked identities without losing session context.


## User Status & Control

Suspend or reactivate users on demand.
Define custom states (e.g., pending approval, archived) to align with internal governance workflows.

* **User Activation**: Enable new users and grant them access to applications.
* **User Suspension**: Temporarily revoke access without deleting the user account.
* **Custom Status States**: Define organization-specific user states (e.g., onboarding, pending approval, archived).
* **Bulk Operations**: Perform status changes across multiple users efficiently.
* **Audit Trail**: Track all user status changes for compliance and governance.


## User Lifecycle Management

Manage the complete user lifecycle from onboarding to offboarding with automated workflows and manual controls.

* **Self-Service Registration**: Enable users to sign up with configurable approval workflows.
* **Invitation-Based Onboarding**: Send secure invitations to new users with pre-configured roles.
* **Account Verification**: Enforce email or phone verification for enhanced security.
* **Offboarding Automation**: Automatically revoke access and archive data when users leave.


## User Search & Filtering

Quickly locate and manage users with advanced search and filtering capabilities.

* **Advanced Search**: Search by email, name, custom attributes, or team membership.
* **Filtering Options**: Filter users by status, role, team, or authentication method.
* **Export Capabilities**: Export user lists for reporting and analysis.

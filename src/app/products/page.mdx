# Products

**Tactna** is a unified customer identity lifecycle platform for multi-app enterprises applications.
We provide enterprise-grade user and team management capabilities that scale with your business—without the complexity of building it yourself.

## Overview

Tactna solves the post-authentication challenge that CIAM platforms don't address: **comprehensive user and organizational management across your entire product ecosystem**.

While authentication providers like Auth0 and Cognito handle login, Tactna manages everything that happens after: user profiles, team hierarchies, role-based access control, self-service administration, and cross-application identity sharing.

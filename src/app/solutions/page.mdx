## Problem in CIAM

***Login is Solved. User Management Remains Fragmented***

CIAM Platforms like Auth0 unified customer login.
But every new product still rebuilds user, org, and access management from scratch.
That has caused several problems.

{/* ![ciam_problems](/docs/solutions/ciam_problems.png) */}

### Separate User Management per App
Each application has independently designed and implemented its own user management system.
Without standardized workflows, this leads to significant operational overhead and increased costs.
When user IDs are managed separately, passwords must also be stored individually in each app, creating security and UX challenges.

### Disconnected Organizations and Roles
The design phase failed to properly incorporate role-based access control functionality and organizational concepts required for B2B operations, resulting in a patchwork implementation approach.
Particularly regarding organizational concepts, incorporating them after initial development proves extremely challenging, sometimes leading to project abandonment.

### Manual Provisioning & Access Control 
ID integrations between IDaaS and app are not automated or access requests are approved manually, resulting in manual operations based on inquiries or complicated procedures.
Furthermore, implementing feature controls by contract plan and user requires significant development effort.


## Negative Impact Caused by Fragmented User Management

***Fragmented User Management Kills Growth***

Cost & Lost Growth: Companies rebuild the same user management and portal layer for every product, leading to millions in redundant cost and slower expansion.

### 1. Cost Explosion
Manual provisioning across Apps.
Rebuilding Admin Portals for each service.
Compliance & access reviews repeated per product.
Fragmented identity systems cost companies ~$3.8 M / yr in duplicated setup &maintenance.” Avatier 2024

### 2. Broken Experience
Customers manage multiple logins & inconsistent access.
Partner managers manually add/remove users..
“17 % of users abandon purchases due to login friction.” Auth0 Customer Identity Trends 2025

### 3. Lost Revenue
Upsell/Cross-sell across products becomes manual.
No unified view of which customer owns which product.
“Cross-selling drives 35 % of total sales; poor identity silos block that potential.” Dinmo 2025

# B2B

As the number of provided services expands, executing effective marketing and sales strategies becomes increasingly important.
However, implementing authentication separately for each service makes data aggregation and utilization difficult while also potentially hindering the user experience.
By establishing a unified identity management platform as a common authentication foundation that also enables SSO, we can enable "data-driven" strategy execution to maximize business potential while improving customer experience.

### 1. Industry-standard authentication and authorization functionality with organizational context consideration

By utilizing the following cross-cutting features essential for B2B applications, development can be performed with minimal rework based on best practices:

- Organizational concept treating companies, departments, and other entities as single units
- Authorization information management framework for multiple services

### 2.  User-oriented and business-oriented portals

The authentication platform includes essential portal functionality, enabling rapid deployment and onboarding of authentication systems.

- User portal
- Business user portal

The user portal in particular allows self-service operations including service registration, basic information entry, and organizational member management, significantly reducing operational workload and costs.

### 3. Extensibility for system integration and business requirements

Through custom screen and workflow functionality, unique requirements such as billing management, contract management, and integration with internal systems can be flexibly implemented.

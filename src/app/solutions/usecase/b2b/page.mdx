# B2B

As the number of applications expands, executing effective marketing and sales strategies becomes increasingly important.
However, implementing authentication separately for each application makes data aggregation and utilization difficult while potentially hindering user experience.
By establishing a unified identity management platform as a common authentication foundation with SSO capabilities, organizations can enable data-driven strategy execution to maximize business potential while improving customer experience.

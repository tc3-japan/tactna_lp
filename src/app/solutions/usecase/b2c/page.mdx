# B2C

For customer-facing applications, UX and self-service functionality are critical.
From a UX perspective, we require frictionless sign-up, login, and password reset processes. Additionally, we must carefully design the user migration flow when implementing unified identity solutions.
From a self-service perspective, users should be able to manage their own accounts independently, and application activation on the authentication platform should be achievable without requiring support inquiries.

### 1. Frictionless Sign-up

To prevent user drop-off during the sign-up process—including terms of service acceptance, email verification, and minimal profile information entry—we need a unified standard sign-up flow across our authentication platform.
Alternatively, custom flow implementations can be achieved through API integration.

### 2. Self-Service Account Management

With customer applications typically handling large user bases, the ideal scenario is allowing users to handle all necessary operations themselves.
By utilizing the standard-provided portal, users can perform self-service operations for profile information and application usage management, significantly reducing operational workload.
Even for applications with specific custom requirements, flexible solutions can be achieved through custom feature implementations.

### 3. User Migration Flow

When migrating users from existing databases to our authentication platform, a smooth migration process is essential to minimize user burden and prevent application dropout.
By combining batch and JIT migration methods, we can complete the transition with minimal or zero downtime.

* When using Auth0 as an Identity Provider, password hashes from existing databases can also be imported during the migration process.

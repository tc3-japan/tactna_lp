# B2C

For consumer applications, user experience and self-service capabilities are critical success factors.
From a UX perspective, organizations require frictionless sign-up, login, and password reset flows. Additionally, careful consideration must be given to user migration strategies when implementing unified identity solutions.
From a self-service perspective, users should be able to manage their accounts independently, with application activation achievable without support intervention.

### 1. Frictionless Sign-up

To minimize user drop-off during registration—including terms acceptance, email verification, and profile creation—Tactna provides a unified, optimized sign-up flow across the authentication platform.
Custom registration flows can also be implemented through comprehensive API integration.

### 2. Self-Service Account Management

With consumer applications typically serving large user bases, enabling complete user self-sufficiency is essential for scalability.
Tactna's standard portal enables users to manage profiles and application access independently, dramatically reducing support burden.
Applications with unique requirements can leverage custom feature implementations for tailored experiences.

### 3. Seamless User Migration

When migrating from existing authentication systems, a smooth transition is essential to minimize user friction and prevent churn.
By using both batch and Just-In-Time (JIT) migration strategies, enabling minimal or zero-downtime transitions. In detail, when selecting Auth0 as an Identity Provider, existing password hashes can be seamlessly imported, preserving user credentials.

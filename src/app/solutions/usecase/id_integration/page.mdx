# ID Integration

In larger companies, different departments often use separate IdPs for customer applications, meaning users must maintain separate accounts with each IdP.
This situation makes implementing consistent security controls across the organization difficult, while also creating UX challenges as users must manage multiple credentials.
To address this, implementing a central IdP that centrally manages authentication can improve both security and UX.

### 1. Unified Security Standards Through ID Consolidation
Centralizing IDs and passwords in the central IdP enables consistent authentication management across the company, reducing the risk of security incidents.

### 2. Enhanced UX Through Single-Sign-On
Users can access all applications with a single ID and password, facilitating the use of similar applications and creating opportunities for synergies.

### 3. Maintaining Departmental Autonomy
The department-managed IDaaS serves as the front-end, allowing flexible handling of detailed authorization processes and unique controls as needed. This approach balances centralized management with necessary operational flexibility.

Suppliers' administrators will properly manage their organization's members to maintain account validity and reduce information leakage risks.
Implement measures such as locking accounts that remain inactive for a specified period, and assist administrators in conducting regular ID inventory checks.

By integrating with the supplier's Identity Provider, suppliers can take responsibility for ID/password management.

Unified user management and approval workflows through Tactna reduce operational costs compared to managing each app individually, while also alleviating the burden of inquiry response management.

### 1. Enhanced Security

Supplier administrators maintain full control over their organization's members, ensuring account validity and minimizing data leakage risks.
This enables automated security measures such as automatic account suspension for inactive users.

### 2. Improved Operational Efficiency

Supplier administrators gain comprehensive control over member access and service utilization through a single interface.
Tactna's unified management and approval workflows deliver cost reduction compared to per-application management, while eliminating manual support ticket handling.

### 3. Enhanced User Experience

Single sign-on across all partner applications eliminates password fatigue, delivering a seamless experience that strengthens supplier relationships and improves service perception.

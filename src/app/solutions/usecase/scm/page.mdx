# Supply Chain Management

This system can also be utilized for managing users of suppliers and agents. Tactna serves as the central hub for these app groups, enabling unified ID management to achieve: 1. enhanced security, 2. improved operational efficiency, and 3. enhanced user experience.

### 1. Enhanced Security

Suppliers' administrators will properly manage their organization's members to maintain account validity and reduce information leakage risks.
Implement measures such as locking accounts that remain inactive for a specified period, and assist administrators in conducting regular ID inventory checks.

By integrating with the supplier's Identity Provider, we will make ID/password management the supplier's responsibility.

### 2. Improved Operational Efficiency

Ensure proper management of organizational members and utilized services by supplier administrators.
Unified user management and approval workflows through Tactna reduce operational costs compared to managing each app individually, while also alleviating the burden of inquiry response management.

### 3. Enhanced User Experience

Single ID&PW enables SSO across all applications, improving end-user UX and enhancing their perception of the service.
